## ABSTRACT
<p>
The Smart Parking System with Indoor Navigation and
Payment Calculation introduces a paradigm shift in the realm
of urban mobility. By harnessing the capabilities of inertial
sensors, the project addresses the limitations of traditional
GPS-based systems in indoor environments. These sensors,
including accelerometers and gyroscopes, enable accurate
estimation of movement and directional changes, empowering
users to navigate intricate indoor parking spaces seamlessly.
</p>
<p>Through the integration of real-time parking availability
updates, the system tackles one of the most persistent
challenges in urban settings: parking congestion. Users gain
access to up-to-the-minute information about available
parking spots, minimizing search times and alleviating traffic
buildup. Furthermore, the project's user-centric approach
extends to the payment process, where duration-based
calculations ensure fair and transparent fees. With the
integration of trusted payment gateways like Razorpay, the
system guarantees secure transactions and a frictionless
payment experience.</p>
